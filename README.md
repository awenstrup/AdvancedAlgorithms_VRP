# Vehicle Routing Problem

## Advanced Algorithms Final Project: Alex Wenstrup and Sander Miller

# Intro

This repository contains the code for our Advanced Algorithms final project. We implemented a genetic algorithm to solve a vehicle routing problem involving warehouse surveillance. Please read our final report, linked below, for more details on our project.

# Running Code

* Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:awenstrup/AdvancedAlgorithms_VRP.git` and move into the directory.

* Install requirements with `pip install -e requirements.txt`

* Move into our source code directory and run main with `cd src && python3 main.py`

If you want to play around with parameters and run our algorithm on a warehouse of your own, see `main.py`, `evolution.py`, and `path.txt`. These files are pretty readable and provide most high level functionality. Other files provide low level implementation details.
